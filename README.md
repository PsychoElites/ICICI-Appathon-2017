# Providing Talkback Facility for Differently Abled 

We propose to develop a platform that provides an ability to the differently abled people to utilize the prowess of modern day banking services. We believe that the banking services should be accessible to everyone.

The idea is to make an interactive interface which will ease up the process of Banking Services. The user will give voice commands to perform some functions. Although, this is mostly backend work, we can implement this feature in a standalone desktop application. 

# Objectives

- To provide the best technical assistance to people with physical disability.
- To increase the functionality of the banking app.
- Easy to use for customers.
- “Keyboard-less” environment.

# Scope

The implementation of this feature in the banking application can help them in various ways. This will broaden the horizon of the banking services, hence, rendering the banks to provide their services to more assortment of people. This will result in more crowd engagement.

Currently no banking system is offering this service for differently abled people. With this application we hope to inculcate the feeling of independence in them. The application aims to provide a “voice recognition, keyboard-less” environment.
